Project Pokemon Beta – Battle System 

Project Beta – Pokémon, I created an battle system similar the original franchise, incorporating a tier system of encountering common to rare pokemon and recreating its turned based battle elements.


Progress Summary

  The current state of this project is almost complete. The game can now essentially nearly execute the full simulation of a standard pokemon battle. It can now navigate through the options in each selected menu, also being able to perform back and forth actions between the user and the encountered pokemon. The next step for this project will be to close out the battle once a pokemon runs out of HP. One final step afterwards would be to clean up the code as much as possible.
